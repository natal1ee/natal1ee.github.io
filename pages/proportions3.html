            <p class="p1">There are a plentiful amount of proportional relationships in the real world. They are easy to overlook, but they exist! In my personal life, for example, I go grocery shopping on an almost weekly basis. Recently, I have been buying juice pouches (yes, juice pouches) on my shopping trips. Specifically, I have been buying the Capri Sun Fruit Punch pouches at a ShopRite.</p>
            <p class="p2">One package of Capri Sun Fruit Punch costs $2.99.  There are 60 fluid ounces total, so each fluid ounce costs $0.05. This means that there are 10 total pouches in one package. The relationship between the fluid ounces and cost per ounce is a proportion; if there are more fluid ounces, then the cost increases and vice versa. However, this proportion relationship is not the main relationship I am referring to.</p>
            <p class="p3">As stated earlier, each package costs $2.99. If I buy one package, then the total cost is $2.99. But if I decide to buy two packages, then the cost will be $5.98. The cost will either rise, stay at the initial price, or be zero dollars depending on how many packages I would like to buy. And, yes, this relates to me because I bought two packages on a prior grocery trip.</p>
