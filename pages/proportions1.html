            <p class="para1">Hearing the term 'proportions' does little to pique my interest. To me, proportions do not hold any significant meaning. While I acknowledge that proportions impact my life in some way or another, they are not something that I think about constantly.</p>
            <p class="para2">However, proportions being chosen out of the other topics was no coincidence. All throughout my school years, I have never struggled (much) with proportions. Out of the other topics, proportions probably caused me the least pain, which I appreciate. This definitely sounds unprofessional.</p>
            <p class="para3">To conclude this section, proportions have occurred in my school life more times than one. I enjoy the fact that I generally do not struggle with proportions, and there is meaning to that, albeit not significant.</p>
