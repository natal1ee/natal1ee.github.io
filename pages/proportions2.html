            <p class="paragraph1">Proportions are two ratios that are set equal to each other. This can relate to rate of change. Rate of change is "the ratio between the x and y values in a relationship" (Foundation, CK-12). That being said, it is clear that these two topics relate to each other since they both involve ratios.</p>
            <p class="paragraph2">Proportions can also be related to inverses. These are called "inverse proportions" and occur when one value increases and the other decreases ("Direct and Inverse Proportion"). As far as any other topic goes, I could not find correlation.</p>
